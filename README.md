# Font-detection

Using deep learning , creating a font detection model , which is capable of detecting fonts from images and designs .

# Dataset

Since AdobeVFR Dataset is huge in size and contains lot of font categories. https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o320sowg790cxpe/AAAw2l7aeTH1fJqkVXoaZmTga/Raw%20Image/VFR_real_test/TimesLTStd-Bold?dl=0&subfolder_nav_tracking=1

# Platform

I am using Google - colab / Anaconda - Navigator for training the dataset and building the model.

# Packages

scikit-learn
